# 🍳 Cooking Note

**Cooking Note** is a recipe management web app built to help users organize, discover, and interact with their favorite recipes. This was my **first JavaScript project**, where I explored dynamic DOM manipulation, form handling, interactivity, and simple animations to create a modern and user-friendly experience.

> 💡 I'm currently having my full-stack courses. This project marks the end of my JavaScript phase.

## 📚 Learning Reflections

As my first JavaScript project, I learned how to:

- Handle events and user input via forms
- Manipulate and update the DOM in real time
- Organize functions for modular interactivity
- Style with CSS animations and responsive layout
- Think like a user and design around real needs

## 🔮 Upcoming Improvements

- Type tags and background color themes
- Popup form and floating shopping list
- LocalStorage integration
- A complete **React version** after finishing React/Node.js courses
